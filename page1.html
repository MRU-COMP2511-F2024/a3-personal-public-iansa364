                <h3>Project Description</h3>
               <p> For my first web development project, I was tasked with creating a website using only HTML and CSS. This
                website needed to showcase basic skills in web structure, design, and styling. My primary goal was to
                design a simple shop webpage with a clean layout and intuitive navigation, incorporating product images
                and descriptive text.</p>

                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>The development process was both exciting and challenging. I started by drafting a basic wireframe to
                outline the layout of the webpage. Using HTML, I structured the webpage with sections for the header,
                product categories, individual product descriptions, and a footer. I then applied CSS to bring the page
                to life, focusing on typography, colors, and spacing to create a visually appealing and functional
                design.</p>

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>One of the hardest aspects of this project was achieving the desired behavior and alignment in CSS. For
                example, I struggled with positioning product images the way I wanted them to be positioned. I used float to position my images.</p>

                <h3>Learning</h3>
                <p>This project was a significant learning experience. It helped me grasp the importance of proper
                structuring and semantic HTML, as well as the power of CSS in shaping the user experience. I learned to
                embrace debugging as part of the creative process, using browser developer tools to inspect elements and
                resolve layout issues.
