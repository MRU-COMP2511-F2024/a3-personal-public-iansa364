        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            This ePortfolio serves as the fourth artifact. I was asked to create a platform that demonstrates the
            technologies and principles learned during the course. These include concepts like grid layouts, flexbox,
            Bootstrap for responsive design, CSS styling for customization, and Gestalt principles for effective
            visual design.
        </p>
        <h3>Development Process and Challenges</h3>
        <p>
            During the development process, I faced challenges aligning navigation links and ensuring responsive design
            across devices. Initially, I struggled with positioning the navigation bar using flexbox but resolved it
            by switching to Bootstrap's navbar classes, which provided a more intuitive structure. Additionally, I
            learned how to integrate multimedia, such as an audio clip, while maintaining design consistency.
        </p>
        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>
            This project significantly enhanced my understanding of layout design and responsive principles. It allowed
            me to apply my knowledge of CSS grids and flexbox creatively and reinforced the importance of planning and
            testing designs. Through this process, I not only improved my technical skills but also gained confidence in
            building visually appealing, functional web pages.
