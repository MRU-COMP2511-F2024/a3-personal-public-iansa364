            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>For my second artefact, I revisited my initial website to enhance it by making it responsive and
                accessible. These improvements aimed to ensure the website functioned well across devices, such as
                mobile phones and
                tablets, and adhered to accessibility standards for a broader audience. The goal was to refine the
                original codebase to demonstrate my evolving technical skills and understanding of web design
                principles.</p>
            <h3>Development Process</h3>
            <p>Working on the same project code after a break was unexpectedly challenging. One of the most significant
                hurdles was deconstructing my original code. Initially, my CSS relied heavily on fixed positioning and
                rigid
                layouts, which were not suitable for responsive design. To address this, I transitioned the layout to
                use
                CSS grid and flexbox. This required rethinking the structure and breaking down the page into smaller,
                flexible components that could adapt fluidly to different screen sizes. Testing the website on devices
                with
                varying screen resolutions taught me how to fine-tune media queries to create a seamless user
                experience.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>A major challenge was improving the website's accessibility. I started by auditing the HTML
                structure
                and realized I had overlooked key accessibility features. For example, I added semantic HTML elements
                like
                main, nav, and section to improve screen reader compatibility. I also updated image elements with
                descriptive alt attributes and ensured interactive elements, like buttons, had proper focus states
                for keyboard navigation. One specific challenge was making sure the color scheme met contrast
                standards; this led to adjusting the palette and testing it using online contrast checkers.</p>

            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p>This artefact represents a critical turning point in my web development journey. It taught me the
                importance of balancing functionality with user-centered design principles. Revisiting the code
                highlighted the importance of writing maintainable code that can evolve with new requirements. I now
                appreciate how crucial it is to start projects with responsiveness and accessibility in mind, as
                retrofitting these features can be time-consuming and intricate.</p>
